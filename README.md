Build a 'sign up' web form.  You'll need to collect some information.
* First Name
* Last Name
* Password
* Title
* Favorite Beatle

In the form build select menus for the Title and Favorite Beatle sections.

Titles:
   Mrs.
   Ms.
   Mr.
   Undetermined

Beatles: [George,Ringo,Paul,John]

After the form submits gather the information and display it on the page.
Also, using the information from the form, build a new username for this person.
* First two letters of the firstname +
* Last two letters of the lastname +
* Index of the selected Beatle (0 or 1 or 2 or 3)+
* first two letters and last letter of the selected Beatles name.

### Extra
1. Extra: Write the new user info to a DB table.
2. Extra Extra: Retrieve the user information from the Database.

###Notes:
If the student has a different database they would prefer to use, they can modify the form to 
conform to their database and generate a string using a different set of requirements that match up with 
the information they're collecting.
The expectation is that the student will be using classes to encapsulate their code.
